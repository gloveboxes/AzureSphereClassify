# Edge Impulse classifier and anomaly detection example on Azure Sphere MT3620

This is an example application that runs an embedded Machine Learning model on the *realtime core* of an Azure Sphere MT3620 board, classifying data coming in on the accelerometer. At [Edge Impulse](https://edgeimpulse.com) we enable developers to create the next generation of intelligent device solutions with embedded Machine Learning - especially when it comes to running ML models on microcontrollers.

## Tool chain

On Windows, copy the *AzureSphereRTCoreToolchainEdgeImpulse.cmake* file to the *C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Azure Sphere SDK\CMakeFiles* folder.
